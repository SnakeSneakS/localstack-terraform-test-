# try localstack & terraform locally
this is just an trial to know how to use terraform and aws (for try locally, I run localstack with docker)

# ussage
- `docker compose up -d`
- open [Web APP](https://app.localstack.cloud/)  (I feel Web APP is better)
- `cd terraform` & run terraform following [terraform README file](./terraform/README.md)
